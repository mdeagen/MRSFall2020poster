					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<aside class="notes">My name is Michael Deagen, here to give you an overview of the platform for data visualization we have built on top of the MaterialsMine Knowledge Graph, an open data resource of curated experimental research data.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<aside class="notes">A knowledge graph database stores data and the links between data in an extensible, machine-readable format. By following semantic web standards, we enable interoperability MaterialsMine and other publicly available datasets, now and in the future.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Objective</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Our new data visualization platform helps us to explore and share information from our knowledge graph in a human-readable format, while providing authors and viewers of charts with autonomy and transparency.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Analogy</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Imagine you have to prepare a meal from scratch. You go to the grocery store with a list and add your ingredients to the cart. When you get home, you prepare those ingredients by following a recipe. After you finish cooking, you serve the meal.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Potential Benefit</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Many charts you find in journal articles are like the meal but without a direct link to the source “ingredients” or how they were prepared. With our platform, you can see the full process all the way back to the grocery store.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Our Approach</h2>
					<aside class="notes">If you think of the grocery store as a database, your grocery list is the query, or request, for a subset of data from that database. The groceries in your cart are data returned by your query. The recipe is like the chart specification that defines the visual encodings of the data, and the meal is the chart which, by the way, you can specify with interactive elements. Just like there are many ways to prepare the same ingredients using different recipes, there are many ways to specify a chart from a given dataset, underscoring the responsibility of chart authors to exercise judgment when designing and specifying charts.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<aside class="notes">The query, written in SPARQL, and the chart specification, written in Vega-Lite, are high-level abstractions that let you create charts with minimal lines of code. Low-level implementation details are handled automatically by the query engine and chart renderer.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<aside class="notes">When a chart is published to our platform, it actually becomes part of the knowledge graph and can be accessed through our Charts Gallery along with its metadata including the title, description, SPARQL query, and Vega-Lite specification.</aside>
